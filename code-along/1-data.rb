# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers

# Non-numbers

# True, False

# Nothing

# Combine strings and variables

# String manipulation
# Put the number 2 on screen
#puts 2

#Put the sum of 5 and 2 on screen
#puts 5+2

# Store 2 and 5 into x and y in memory
#x = 2
#y = 5
#puts x, y
#puts x * y
